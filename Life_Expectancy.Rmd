#Title: Final project proposal

#Description: 
#Data cleaning.
#Data analysis.

#Hypothesis: 
#Null: Immunization factors in developing countries have the same significance 
# in determining life expectancy levels compared to developed countries. 
#Alt: Immunization factors in developing countries have a greater significance in 
# determining the life expectancy level compared to developed countries. 
#Problem to solve: What factors should be targeted when trying to increase 
# the life expectancy across developing and developed countries. 

#Immunization factors: 

# 1. Hepatitis B (not significant)
# 2. Measles (not significant)
# 3. Polio
# 4. Diphtheria
# 5. HIV/AIDS

# Approach: 
# Divide the dataset in developed and developing countries, run preliminary regression
# to indeitify significant variables, check the p-values/coefficients for each
# immunization factor variable. 

# Libraries --------------------------------------------------------------------

#Probably will have to install some of these libraries.

Some of the non-signifcant predictors like Measles and Population are skewed, but this is accpetable as they are not impacting the model been non-significantHence we can say that we have met the assumption for normality


```{r}
kurtosis(final_data[ , -c(1,2,3)], na.rm = TRUE)

#The distribution looks slightly kurtotic but this is acceptable as most data is centred over 0 and between -2 and 2.

#Significance of the Overall model.We can say that the overall model is significant as the effect size(R-squared value) is very high at 0.81, the p-value is less than 0.00001 for a high f-statistic of 264.4.


#Significance of Individual predictors:
#It appears from the model that  Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio and population are the only non-significant predictors in our model since they have a p-value more than 0.05 and a small t-statistic. 
#Schooling seems to be the strongest and the strongest and the most significant positive predictor to predictLife expectancy followed by total expenditure, Alcohol, GDP and Diphtheria in that order. 
#HIV.AIDS is the strongest negative predictor for Life expectancy followed  by Adult Mortality, Under five deaths,thinness 1 to 19 and Hepatitis B.
#Alcohol and Diphtheria were shown as positive predictors for Life Expectancy which was an interesting find.
#For the significant predictors for every one point increase in the variable we get b points increase in the value of 
#y.Schooling is the strongest positive and most significant predictor for Life Expectancy
